## 1. Pure React & createElement

## 2. Pure React Components

React has a concept of components called one-way data flow. Which basically means that i can pass data from app down to pet. i cannot pass data from pet up to app for the most part, let's say 99% of the time you don't.

## 4. npm & Prettier Setup

`npm init -y`

Package.json is where i'm gonna start keeping all of my dependencies

`npm install --save-dev prettier@2.7.1` or `npm i -D prettier@2.7.1` --save-dev or -D is gonna save in the development dependencies

`npm install -D prettier` this will install whatever the lastest version of this

Settings + prettier + prettier required config + checkbox actived ☑️
